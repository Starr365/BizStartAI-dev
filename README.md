# BizStartAI: Your AI-Powered Business Paddy

BizStartAI is a premium, AI-driven platform designed to empower aspiring entrepreneurs and business owners. It acts as a comprehensive "Business Paddy," providing expert mentorship, detailed market insights, and a structured journey from initial idea to a full-fledged business plan. By leveraging advanced generative AI (Google Gemini), BizStartAI simplifies the complexities of starting a business, making professional guidance accessible to everyone.

## 1. Project Overview
BizStartAI is a personalized roadmap for entrepreneurs. It allows users to validate ideas, explore industries, learn through tailored courses, and ultimately generate a professional business plan. The target audience includes first-time founders, small business owners in Africa (specifically targeting the Nigerian market with "Business Paddy" local context), and anyone needing a structured approach to building a company.

## 2. Key Features & Challenges

- **AI Business Mentorship**: A real-time chat interface powered by Google Gemini that provides strategic advice and brainstorming.
- **Dynamic Course Recommendations**: An intelligent system that suggests learning paths based on the user's business idea and stage.
- **Automated Business Plan Generation**: A high-impact feature that synthesizes user inputs into a structured, professional document.

### Technical Challenges Overcome
1.  **Backend-Frontend Synchronization**: Managing complex chat history and user progress across a decoupled React frontend and Node.js backend required careful mapping of API payloads and response structures.
2.  **UI/UX Standardization**: Moving from a collection of hardcoded hex codes and inconsistent emojis to a unified design system using Tailwind CSS 4 and professional React Icons.
3.  **Security Integration**: Securing a multi-provider authentication system (Local + Google OAuth) and ensuring API keys are never leaked to the client.

## 3. Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React 19, Vite, Tailwind CSS 4, Lucide React, React Icons, React Hot Toast, Axios.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize ORM.
- **Database**: TiDB (MySQL compatible).
- **AI Integration**: Google Generative AI (Gemini 2.5/2.0).
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens), Google OAuth 2.0.

## 4. Architecture Overview
BizStart AI follows a modern client-server architecture:
- **Client**: A Single Page Application (SPA) built with React 19. It uses a centralized API utility for all communications.
- **Server**: A Node.js/Express REST API structured into Controllers, Models, and Utils. It handles AI orchestration and database interactions.
- **State Management**: Uses React state hooks and `localStorage` for session persistence (e.g., `userAccount` and `token`).

## 5. Technical Decisions
1.  **TiDB (NewSQL)**: Chosen over traditional MySQL for its horizontal scalability, ensuring the platform can grow without downtime while maintaining 100% MySQL compatibility.
2.  **Tailwind CSS 4**: Used for its superior performance and modern utility-first approach, allowing for a premium UI with minimal bundle size.
3.  **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash**: Selected for its speed and reasoning capabilities, balanced with lower latency for high-quality real-time AI mentorship.

## 6. Setup & Installation
